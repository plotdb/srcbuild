 - track files failed to `get-dependencies` and retry each time a new change event is fired.
 - custom functions access files relative to module root instead of relative to source file.
   - have to access locals to resolve correct path
 - glslify should not be plugged directly inside `lscbuild`.
   - We should remove it, and perhaps make it a independent builder
 - bundler rules from pug file will be gone after srcbuild restarted.
   - we can save file -> hash mapping to be loaded in some mapping file
     - but if the rules are updated, how do we know?
   - alternatively, we can save src files of the rule,
     and parse the src pug file everytime a js/css file is updated to see if a rebuild is necessary.
     - unfortunately this requires a parse of the source pug file. kinda tough
       - we can do this only if pug file is newer.
       - and if the pug file is newer, it probably should be rebuilt
   - so here is the algorithm:
     - 1. pug is compiled. pack rules write to pack/rule.file after bundle is built.
       - rule file store information such as "src-pug": [file list]
     - 2. bundle file is rebuilt if any files in file list is touched.
     - 3. when restarting, rule file is read and used to re-construct bundle rule.
       - if any src-pug listed is newer than bundle file, it probably will also newer than its des file,
         otherwise anyone mess up with the des file. thus, it will trigger the bundle file rebuild.
       - ... and thus bundle file will be regen.
       - however, if pack is disabled ( or removed ) in the newer src-pug, it won't trigger bundle file regen.
       - thus, bundler should be run for rule file regen when rebuilding of src-pug listed.
